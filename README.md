# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model-2023
### DataSet link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023
#### This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
###### Key Features:
###### id: Unique identifier for each transaction
###### V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
###### Amount: The transaction amount
###### Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)
𝘿𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 : Data Science project on Credit Card Fraud Prediction Model, a capstone project by Boston Institute of Analytics! 

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:
In this initiative, I designed and implemented a predictive model aimed at identifying potential fraud in credit card transactions. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising 568,630 rows and 31 columns, the project addresses the critical need for advanced fraud detection in the financial sector.

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐬:
Dataset Characteristics: The dataset used for this project is extensive, containing 568,630 rows, ensuring a rich and diverse representation of credit card transactions.
Data Purity: The model's foundation rests on a dataset devoid of duplicates and missing values. Rigorous pre-processing was undertaken to guarantee the cleanliness and completeness of the data, elevating the model's accuracy and reliability.

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬:
The project has yielded impressive results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, showcasing its efficacy in detecting credit card fraud. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model contributes to enhancing the security and trustworthiness of financial transactions.
I have used Four Models to Predict the accuracy as a part of the Project
Model 1 - 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗿, 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 = 𝟵𝟵.𝟵𝟳𝟵𝟳𝟳%
Model 2 - Logistic Regression, Accuracy = 96.49596%
Model 3 - XGBClassifier, Accuracy = 99.97010%
Model 4 - Support Vector Machine, Accuracy = 99.70894%

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭:
This project has significant implications for the financial industry, providing a proactive approach to combatting credit card fraud. The model's reliability makes it a valuable asset for financial institutions looking to bolster their security measures and protect their clients from potential risks.𝘿𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 Data Science project on Credit Card Fraud Prediction Model
